Interactive Fiction POC for Amazon Alexa. Figure out if ZORK-style interactive fiction is usable and fun with a speech interface instead of text.
"Alexa, launch Future."

TODO:
- [ ] TellWithCard? Can you put images in cards? Should be secondary and not needed to play the game.
- [ ] If intent doesn't match the scene, disregard it
- [ ] Can wait-times be increased before process is exited, or can that not be changed?
